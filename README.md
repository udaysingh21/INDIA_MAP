# Interactive Maps with Folium and Pandas
This Python project utilizes the Folium and Pandas libraries to create interactive maps for geospatial analysis and visualization. With features such as custom markers, heatmaps, and the ability to plot data from CSV files, this project offers a versatile solution for geospatial data analysis.

# Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:
1. Folium
2. Pandas

# Installation
You can install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install folium pandas

# Usage
